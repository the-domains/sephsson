# About me

## Film - Photo - Graphic Design

I am 24 years old, with a creative mind and a love for entrepreneurship. That is why I started my own company, for approximately two year ago. Here I focus on Film, Photo and Graphic design. I am currently renting a desk at Talentum Sverige, in central Stockholm. Talentum is a Media house with several magazines and events, I help them with different Graphic designs such as; presentations, logos, graphic profiles, invitations and more. I recently filmed and edited a Kickstarter campaign for Herrstil and their Myrqvist shoes, which reached 600% over the goal. Film- and Photo-wise I do close to everything; production photos, event film/ photo, music videos, documentaries, commercials and much more.
